# To-do list
This is a to-do list app developed as part of a coding test for the Atom Chat company.
Inspired by **this** Simpsons to do list, I decided to go for a paper like, handwritten design.

To accomplish that style, after a day of searching for components and styles, I stumbled upon PaperCSS, a components library that was the perfect fit. Since it also included some layout and flexbox components which I didn't need since I was going to using Tailwind, I cloned the PaperCSS repo and made some changes to leave out some of the classes that I wouldn't use, in order to avoid conflicts with Tailwind.

- TypeScript 5.1.3.
- Angular 16.2.0
- TailwindCSS 3.3.3
- PaperCSS 1.9.2
